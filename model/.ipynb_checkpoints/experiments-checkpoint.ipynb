This model is useful because it can predict winners, loosers, tie events, amount of goals, and different scenarios, the bad thing is that our design is pretty naive (the desgining of the proper model can be a whole thesis). In the latter models, less ambitious more powerful, we are only predicting if the home team is going to win or if it will loose or tie. "
